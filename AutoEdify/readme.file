Project Initialization:

 Folder Setup: The project folder is named AutoEdify.

Creating package.json : Using the VS code terminal, the command “npm init -y” was run to create a package.json file. This file manages the project’s metadata and dependencies.

Installed Packages:
Express: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js to handle routing and server logic.
EJS(Embedded JavaScript): A templating engine that allows embedding JavaScript logic into HTML files.
Mongoose: A library that provides a structured way to interact with MongoDB, including schema creation.
Nodemon: A development tool that automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.


	2.Project Structure: 

Main File (app.js): The entry point of the application. This file:
Requires necessary modules like Express, Mongoose, and others.
Set up middleware and routes.
Connects to the MongoDB database.

Folder Organization:
views/ Folder:
Contains EJS files used for rendering the frontend.
EJS files are HTML files with embedded JavaScript logic. They allow dynamic content to be displayed by passing data from the backend to the templates.

public/ Folder:
Stores static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript.
Subfolders include:
Images (for storing image files).
stylesheets (for CSS files).
javascripts (for custom JavaScript files).

src/ Folder:
Houses database-related files and models.
db/conn.js: Contains code to connect to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
models/registers.js: Defines the schema and model for storing user data related to car maintenance tasks.


3. Backend Technologies Explained:
Express.js: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications by providing:
Routing: Managing URLs and HTTP methods.
Middleware: Functions that execute during the request-response cycle.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is well-suited for applications requiring scalability and fast querying.
Mongoose: A Node.js library used to interact with MongoDB. Features include:
Schema definitions to structure data.
Validation of data before saving to the database.
Built-in query methods to interact with the database easily.
Nodemon: A development tool that monitors changes in the source files and automatically restarts the server for quicker development.

	
	4. Routing in app.js:
Routing defines how the application responds to client requests.
GET Request:
Retrieves data or serves HTML pages.
Example: A GET request to / might render the home page.
POST Request:
Sends data to the server to be processed.
Example: A POST request to /add-maintenance might save a new car maintenance task to the database.

5. EJS Files:
EJS files are template files used to dynamically generate HTML by embedding JavaScript.
Features:
<%= variable %> to output data.
<% logic %> to include JavaScript logic like loops or conditionals.



6. Database Connection:
conn.js:
Uses Mongoose to connect to MongoDB with a connection string.
Handles database connectivity errors or success messages.
Schema Definition:
registers.js:
Defines a schema for car maintenance tasks with fields like task name, date, and description.
The schema is exported as a Mongoose model for use in other files.




7. Static Files in public/:
Static files are files that do not change dynamically and are directly served to the user.
Images: Stored in the images/ folder.
CSS: Styling files stored in the stylesheets/ folder.
JavaScript: Custom scripts stored in the javascripts/ folder.



8. Additional Concepts:
NPM (Node Package Manager):
Used to manage packages and dependencies for the project.
npm install command adds packages listed in package.json.
Middleware:
Functions executed during the lifecycle of a request.
Example: Middleware to serve static files using express.static.
Modular Code:
Routes, database connections, and schemas are separated into different files to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.





Conclusion:
 The Car Maintenance Tracker project effectively combines frontend and backend technologies to create a robust application. By following a modular and structured approach, it ensures maintainability, scalability, and ease of development. Each component, from routing to database integration, plays a vital role in delivering a seamless user experience.
